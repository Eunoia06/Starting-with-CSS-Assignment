    <h2 class="subheading">Introduction to CSS</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, play a crucial role in modern web development by providing a mechanism to style and format HTML documents. CSS enables web developers to control the appearance of web pages, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience across various devices and screen sizes. With its modular and cascading nature, CSS allows for the separation of content and presentation, making it easier to manage and update the design of a website.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subheading_2">Key Concepts and Features</h2>
    <p class="paragraph_1">CSS introduces several key concepts and features that contribute to its flexibility and power. Selectors allow developers to target specific elements or groups of elements, while properties define the visual aspects such as color, size, and spacing. The cascading nature of CSS enables the combination of multiple style sheets, with styles applied based on specificity and order of precedence.</p>
    <p class="paragraph_2">Responsive design, another important aspect of CSS, ensures that websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries in CSS allow developers to apply styles selectively based on factors like screen width, height, or device orientation. This responsiveness is crucial in today's diverse landscape of devices, from desktop monitors to smartphones and tablets.</p>
